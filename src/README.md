# Face Detection with MediaPipe and OpenCV

This is a simple face detection project built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.  
It was developed as a demonstration of how to use **MediaPipe's Face Detection** capabilities to identify and highlight human faces in real-time using a webcam.

The main goal is to showcase how easily MediaPipe can be integrated with OpenCV to create computer vision applications.  
This project captures video from your webcam, detects faces in each frame, and displays them with visual markers in a live window.
